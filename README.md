# logo-maker

## Description

This project was build for anyone who wanted to have a simple, three word logo without having to create one themselves using photoshop or any other editing software and have it within seconds after inputting the information needed. Creating this solves the issues of anyone who is looking for a fast way to make a logo for a project, profile picture, or etc. This helped me learn how to use and get a better understanding on how constructors, classes, and test.js. Another thing it taught me is that there is many ways to aproach this project with getting the same results.

## Installation

In order to get the project to work, you will need to install Node js. v16, inquirer version 8.2.4, and Jest. When you open VS code, open the integrated interminal, type in npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install inquirer, npm init -y and npm i for packages, and npm i jest to add the jest.

When everything has been installed, open the integrated terminal, type in node index to then answer the following questions prompted to you and once complete, your logo will be created. To test out each of the test, open the integrated terminal through the one of the test files, type in npm run test and there will be an indication if the test have passed or not.
